    "In conclusion, python provides you with a built-in way of providing useful documentation to users of your code. As you've seen in these examples, it is very quick and easy to write docstrings and add them to your code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different formats for docstrings, but whichever format you choose to use, you should include at a minimum:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a brief description of what your function or class does\n",
    "* a description of any publicly accessible attributes (for classes)\n",
    "* a description of any input parameters for functions\n",
    "* a description of any return values\n",
    "* a listing of any exceptions thrown by the code and what causes them\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fancier Documentation\n",
    "In addition to the built-in documentation using docstrings, with the following commands, python can stand up a small webserver and render your documentation in a webbrowser.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# For command line\n",
    ">>> python -m pydoc -b\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# For Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "!python -m pydoc -b\n",
