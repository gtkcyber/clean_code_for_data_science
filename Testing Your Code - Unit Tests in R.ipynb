    "# Testing Your Code - Unit Tests in R\n",
    "This scenario walks you through another key concept in a developer's toolkit: unit tests. As a data scientist, we often don't really think about testing our code, but using unit tests can help you write better code, faster and spend less time debugging.  Using unit tests will also help you keep your code working properly as you modify and improve your code. So let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson you'll learn:\n",
    "* What are unit tests?\n",
    "* How to write effective unit tests \n",
    "* How to use the `testthat` framework in R\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Unit Tests?\n",
    "A unit test is an automated way of testing small blocks of code (usually functions) by executing that code and compares the behavior with expected results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the following scenario: you have some data pipeline that needs an email address as an input. To make sure that the data is valid to begin with, you might create a function called `isValidEmail()` that accepts an email address as an argument and returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the email is valid or not.  This may seem like a simple situation, but how do you know that the function works in all cases?  What happens if the function receives no input?  What happens if the function receives more than one email address? \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to make sure that your code is going to do what you expect it to do, is to write unit tests to actually test that your code does what you want it to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit Test Frameworks\n",
    "What I have described seems fairly straightforward, and for simple cases it is, however in every language there are unit test frameworks that can assist you in crafting effective unit tests.  Python has several, but the one that is included with the main python packages is creatively called `unittest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most all unit test frameworks have similar core features which are functionalities to:\n",
    "* Setup the environment prior to running tests\n",
    "* Execute code\n",
    "* Compare results with expected results, usually with a collection of `expect_()` methods\n",
    "* Clean up environment after running tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Frameworks will have other features as well, but these are the basic core functionalities, regardless of what framework you choose to use."

    "## Writing Effective Unit Tests\n",

    "\n",
    "* Keep them short:  Unit tests should not be lengthy demonstrations of code cleverness. They should be simple, quick and easy to understand. If your tests are too complicated, sometimes you can spend hours trying to fix an issue that in fact was not in your code, but rather in your test.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write unit tests as you go: Unit tests should not be an after thought. You should write them as you so that you identify bugs early and often. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Name your tests clearly:  As mentioend earlier, you should name your tests clearly so that it is obvious what failed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Test failure as well as success: When writing unit tests, think creatively about what could go wrong and write a test for that.  For instance, if you're populating a dataframe with data pulled from an external source, what happens if the source is unreachable?  What happens if the source changes their data format? Carefully considering what can go wrong can prevent disasters later.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't forget edge cases:  These are actually some of the most important unit tests. Give some thought to what edge cases exist and make sure you write a unit test for them.\n",
